            <span class="richtext">
                In the dynamic realm of design, my life unfolds as a tapestry woven with pixels and purpose. From the moment I stumbled upon the captivating world of UI design, I found my true calling—a fusion of artistry and functionality that resonates with the heartbeat of users. <br /><br />From my background UI & UX designers & digital artists are all considered as graphic designers, and the society at large doesn’t know about every design layer that is archivable.<br /><br />I found out that its not just about crafting visually appealing interfaces; it was about making technology seamlessly integrate into people's lives. What hooked me was the power to solve problems, and create experiences that leave an indelible mark. <br /><br />Each project becomes a new canvas, and every interaction is an opportunity to connect with users on a profound level. The incessant pursuit of perfection, the thrill of bringing concepts to life, and the ever-evolving landscape of design are the driving forces that fuel my passion. <br /><br />UI design isn't just a profession; it's a journey of discovery, innovation, and the joy of turning imagination into reality.

                In another spectrum of my life, digital art has always challenged my way of thinking in an artistical way and my knowledge surrounding machines in human-computer interaction<br /><br>I started out in virtual photography where i take video game screenshots and make concept art by color grading or editing out to create something new.<br /><br>Check out my verified social page<a>here</a><br>

            <span class="text">Rugby career</span>
            <span class="richtext">
                For me, is not just a game. Thanks to my father who was a seasoned rugby player, I was naturally drawn to the sport that shaped my early memories, growing up to the deafening sound of cleats on the field. I was inspired by watching one world cup season when i was still a kid.<br /><br />What keeps me interested is the relationship among teammates, the symphony of training, and the strategic plays between opponents. <br /><br />The rugby field is my proving ground, where i go out and relieve myself from my daily activities.<br /><br />Career-wise, the sport isn't merely a pursuit; it's a dedication to surpass limits, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. In every scrum and sprint, I find a testament to an enduring legacy in my lifetime.
