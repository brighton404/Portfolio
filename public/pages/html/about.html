            In the dynamic realm of design, my life unfolds as a tapestry
            woven with pixels and purpose. From the moment I stumbled upon the
            captivating world of UI design, I found my true calling-a fusion
            of artistry and functionality that resonates with the heartbeat of
            users.

            From my background UI & UX designers & digital artists are all
            considered as graphic designers, and the society at large doesn’t
            know about every design layer that is archivable. I found out that
            its not just about crafting visually appealing interfaces; it was
            about making technology seamlessly integrate into people's lives.
            What hooked me was the power to solve problems, and create
            experiences that leave an indelible mark. Each project becomes a
            new canvas, and every interaction is an opportunity to connect
            with users on a profound level. The incessant pursuit of
            perfection, the thrill of bringing concepts to life, and the
            ever-evolving landscape of design are the driving forces that fuel
            my passion.

            UI design isn't just a profession; it's a journey of discovery,
            innovation, and the joy of turning imagination into reality.

        <b class="my-passion-in">My attraction into digital art</b>
        <div class="in-the-dynamic-container">
          In another spectrum of my life, digital art has always challenged my
          way of thinking in an artistical way and my knowledge surrounding
          machines in human-computer interaction. I started out in virtual
          photography where i take video game screenshots and make concept art
          by color grading or editing out to create something new.

        <b class="my-passion-in">Rugby career</b>
        <div class="in-the-dynamic-container">
          <p class="in-the-dynamic">
            For me, is not just a game. Thanks to my father who was a seasoned
            rugby player, I was naturally drawn to the sport that shaped my
            early memories, growing up to the deafening sound of cleats on the
            field. I was inspired by watching one world cup season when i was
            still a kid.
          </p>
          <p class="in-the-dynamic">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="in-the-dynamic">
            What keeps me interested is the relationship among teammates, the
            symphony of training, and the strategic plays between opponents.
            The rugby field is my proving ground, where i go out and relieve
            myself from my daily activities. Career-wise, the sport isn't
            merely a pursuit; it's a dedication to surpass limits, and a
            relentless pursuit of excellence. In every scrum and sprint, I
            find a testament to an enduring legacy in my lifetime.

          My logo is a representation of my name as JB from “julius Brighton”.
          I wish i would be able to understand it and show why i chose that
          design type but i guess its something i did not look much into.
