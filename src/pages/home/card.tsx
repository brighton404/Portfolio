          <h3>Approach to UI design</h3>
          <div className="self-stretch relative text-[1.125rem] inline-block">
              I believe in crafting user-centric experiences that seamlessly blend aesthetics with functionality. My approach to UI design is guided by a combination of empathy, creativity, and attention to detail, ensuring that every design decision serves the needs and goals of the end user.

                User-centric Design
                </summary>
                <p>Putting the user at the center of the design process is paramount. I start by thoroughly understanding the target audience, their behaviours, and pain points through user research and analysis. This insight guides the creation of intuitive interfaces that resonate with users and fulfil their needs.</p>

                    <p>Prototyping lies at the heart of my design process. I believe in the power of rapid prototyping to explore and refine concepts iteratively. By creating interactive prototypes, I can gather valuable feedback early in the design process, enabling quick adjustments and improvements based on user insights.</p>

          <h3>Digital art</h3>
          <p>In another spectrum of my life, digital art has always challenged my way of thinking in an artistical way and my knowledge surrounding machines in human-computer interaction.<br/> I started out in virtual photography by capturing video game screenshots and making concept art by color grading or editing out to create something new.</p>

              For me, is not just a game. Thanks to my father who was a seasoned rugby player, I was naturally drawn to the sport that shaped my early memories, growing up to the deafening sound of cleats on the field. I was inspired by watching one world cup season when i was still a kid.

              <p className="m-0">&nbsp;</p>
              <p className="m-0">
              What keeps me interested is the relationship among teammates, the symphony of training, and the strategic plays between opponents. The rugby field is my proving ground, where i go out and relieve myself from my daily activities. Career-wise, the sport isn't merely a pursuit; it's a dedication to surpass limits, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. In every scrum and sprint, I find a testament to an enduring legacy in my lifetime.
